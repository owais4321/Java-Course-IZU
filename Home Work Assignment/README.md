## Assignment 1: Java Variables (Basics Only)

**Objective**: Practice declaring, initializing, and printing variables of different types in Java.

### Tasks

1. **Declare an Integer Variable**  
   - Declare an integer variable named `age`.
   - Assign it the value `21`.
   - Print the value of `age`.

2. **Declare and Initialize a Double Variable**  
   - Declare a double variable named `temperature`.
   - Assign it the value `36.6`.
   - Print the value of `temperature`.

3. **Boolean Variable Declaration**  
   - Declare a boolean variable named `isRaining`.
   - Set `isRaining` to `false`.
   - Print the value of `isRaining`.

4. **Declare and Initialize a Character Variable**  
   - Declare a character variable named `grade`.
   - Assign it the value `'B'`.
   - Print the value of `grade`.

5. **Declare Multiple Variables of the Same Type**  
   - Declare three integer variables in a single line: `x`, `y`, and `z`.
   - Initialize `x` with `5`, `y` with `10`, and `z` with `15`.
   - Print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

6. **Reassigning Variable Values**  
   - Declare an integer variable `count` and initialize it with `1`.
   - Change the value of `count` to `5` and print it.
   - Change the value of `count` to `10` and print it again.

7. **Declare a Constant**  
   - Declare a constant variable `MAX_HEIGHT` with a value of `250` using the `final` keyword.
   - Print the value of `MAX_HEIGHT`.

8. **Declare a Float Variable**  
   - Declare a float variable named `pi` and initialize it with `3.14f`.
   - Print the value of `pi`.

9. **Declare and Print a Long Variable**  
   - Declare a long variable named `distance`.
   - Assign it the value `123456789L`.
   - Print the value of `distance`.

10. **Declare and Initialize Multiple Boolean Variables**  
    - Declare two boolean variables: `isDaytime` and `isWeekend`.
    - Set `isDaytime` to `true` and `isWeekend` to `false`.
    - Print the values of `isDaytime` and `isWeekend`.

### Submission
